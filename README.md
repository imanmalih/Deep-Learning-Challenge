# Deep-Learning-Challenge

## Overview

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.


## Analysis: 

1. What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
     IS_SUCCESSFUL

2. What variable(s) are the features for your model?

      APPLICATION_TYPE
      AFFILIATION
      CLASSIFICATION
      USE_CASE
      ORGANIZATION
      STATUS
      INCOME_AMT
      SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
      ASK_AMT

3. What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

6. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    We were not able to achieve the accuracy of greater than 75%.
